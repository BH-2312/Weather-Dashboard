# Weather-Dashboard
week 6 homework for Coding bootcamp

I began by creating a basic HTML structure to reflect the example that we were provided with. I created .css and .js files and utlised bootstrap, jquery and moment.js to help with application functionality. I utlised a grid structure in HTML to assist with the layout.

I spent a long time researching and understanding the different API's available on openweathermap. I eventually decided upon the API's and the queryURL's that I wanted to returned the output I required. 

I constructed the an AJAX call to gather initial data and used this data to help construct the second AJAX call. A combination of the two AJAX calls helped me to get the data I required for the application. I utlised the learning assistants to assist with some questions regarding using multiple API's and AJAX calls.

I created an onclick event to search for a city. ONce a city is searched, a record of this search is shown on the left hand side of the page.

I utilised moment.js to show  the current date and the following 5 days dates.
